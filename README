How To Build
-------------------------------------------------
Open up terminal and change directory to the location
of 'dictionary.cpp' (make sure all included files
are also located there). Enter the command 'make main' to
compile and build the executable. Proceed to run
the executable, or type './main < file.dat' in
terminal, where 'file.dat' is the file you wish to
read.
*************************************************
How to use
-------------------------------------------------
This program checks the identified file (refer to
How to Build) for words, and their frequency using a
linked list data structure. It will only check for words, 
excluding symbols and spaces. After it has searched the 
file and made it's data, it will sort and output it's 
results in Terminal. For examples of how the output 
works, run the program and direct it to "examplefile" 
or "examplefile2". The following shows the file, 
and it's respective output:

is located. Type 'make clean' to remove all but
